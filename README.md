## Description
This is a learning project for me, the developer, with the goal of practicing writing segmented code for large projects and the documentation practices in the software developing process.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).


## How to run

Then, navigate to the directory

Then, run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
